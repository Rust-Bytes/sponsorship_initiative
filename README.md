# Rust Bytes Sponsorship Initiative

## Future Projections

We know many talented Rust engineers who create exceptional content, courses, resources, and tools that greatly benefit the Rust community. 

With this in mind, we plan to sponsor some of these individuals in the near future.

If you know someone whose Rust-related content or work you admire, we’d love to hear about them and consider supporting their efforts.

Help us by sharing their names via the GitHub link here.

### Nomination Process
- **Who Can Nominate**: Anyone in the Rust community can nominate a creator whose work they admire.
- **What to Share**: Provide the name of the individual and a brief description of their contributions to the Rust community.
- **Where to Submit**: Add your nomination to the section below.
- **Selection Criteria**: We’ll review nominations based on the quality, impact, and relevance of the individual’s contributions to the Rust ecosystem.
