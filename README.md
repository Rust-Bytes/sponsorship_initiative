# Rust Bytes Sponsorship Initiative

We know many talented Rust engineers who create exceptional content, courses, resources, and tools that greatly benefit the Rust community. 

With this in mind, we plan to sponsor some of these individuals in the near future.

If you know someone whose Rust-related content or work you admire, weâ€™d love to hear about them and consider supporting their efforts.
